The Difference in Approach\n","if-else: You need to manually check conditions ahead of time. If you're uncertain whether an operation will succeed, you might need to add checks for all possible error cases.\n","\n","try-except: Allows you to attempt an operation and handle errors if they arise without cluttering your code with numerous checks. It’s especially useful for handling unknown errors that might occur, such as network failures, file access issues, or invalid user input.\n","\n","3. Performance Considerations\n","if-else: Good for predictable conditions where the outcome can be determined before performing an operation.\n","\n","try-except: More efficient for handling exceptions that only happen in specific, less frequent situations, because it avoids pre-checking every possible error condition. However, exceptions can have some performance overhead when they are raised, so you generally don't want to use try-except for routine checks.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Summary:\n","if-else handles known conditions you can check in advance.\n","try-except handles unexpected exceptions that may occur during runtime, allowing you to manage errors gracefully without stopping the program.\n","In short, use if-else for logical branching and checks, and try-except for handling unexpected runtime errors!"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
